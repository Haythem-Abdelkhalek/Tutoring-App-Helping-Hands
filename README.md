# Tutoring-App-Helping-Hands
This is app connects tutors and students and will have all the courses listed eliminating constant emailing between students and tutors. Also, the app will include simple messaging system for tutors and students to chat. Additionally, Supervisors can give permission to new hired tutors to become a “tutor” in the app without contacting any support. Furthermore, students can add personal details in their profile, like “student with disability”, or “retaking this course”, or “Need to practice speaking only (for language tutoring)”. This will help tutors prepare for their sessions before hand and be more efficient. The short-term goal for this app will help UMBC save money by making its own app. The long-term goal is , after debug and implementation, UMBC could sell this product to other universities. The ultimate goal is that this app would make any University’s tutoring service independent. The supervisor would have full control of the app (but not the source code).
