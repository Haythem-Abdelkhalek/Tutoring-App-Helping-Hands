Note: 
Look at “436: ideas ” document  under “is436” folder to refresh your memory about the features of the app
Also, if you haven’t done so already as Haythem suggested, it is preferred if you navigate the Study Tree App for better understanding of what improvements the app needs.
Everyone should contribute

Project Title: Helping Hands
Project Supervisor: Ira Fabri, Supervisor of the Tutoring Program at UMBC
Date of Authorization: February 14th by Professor
Project Start Date: February 13th                                                           Project Finish Date: TBD
Key Schedule Milestones:
System Request and Feasibility  02/17/2019
Planning  TBD
Design of App TBD
Implementation TBD
Application TBD

Budget Information/Value: We expect Helping Hands to increase profit and increase consumer productivity by providing college students the necessary tools and resources, specifically tutors, that will enable them to be successful in their classes. We expect to increase the number of subjects our tutors are able to offer in order to expand our clientele. We expect to provide better ways of communication from student to scheduled tutors by providing a stream of notifications and using internal app’s chat system as a conduit for communication. 
Company estimated value include the following:
$4,000 in sales per semester.
$4,000 in sales per univerity.




Project Manager: Timnit Tesfatsion, tt5@umbc.edu

Project Objectives/Business Need: 
This app will help UMBC save money by making its own app. 
Long-term, after debug and implementation, UMBC could sell this product to other universities. 
The ultimate goal is that this app would make any university’s tutoring service to be independent. The supervisor would have full control of the app (but not the code). 



Main Project Sources Criteria: 
Task 1: 
Give permission to students and tutors the ability to change their schedules. For high-demand, you can use the app to schedule a session. This means that your schedule has to be correct and up-to-date. 
For low-demand, students have to contact the supervisor of the Learning Resource Center through email to be able to see if there’s any tutors for the course they need help with.) 
Task 2: 
All courses have to be listed on the app. No emails between students and tutors.
Task 3: 
The app needs to have a simple messaging system for tutors and students to chat (needed when a student is not coming or going to be late, or simply to ask any information). 
Task 4: 
Supervisors can give permission to new hired tutors to become a “tutor” in the app.(Right now, supervisors have to contact StudyTree support to ask for it. This usually takes days). 
Task 5: 
Students can add personal details in their profile, like “student with disability”, or “retaking this course”, or “Need to practice speaking only (for language tutoring)”. This will help tutors prepare for their sessions before hand and be more efficient.


Approach/Requirements: 
We are going to use the android studio software
Using SQL database with java for the coding aspect

Special Issues or Constraints: 
There are multiple apps on the market that provide tutoring for students. 
In order to gain a big pool of clients, we must complete this project as soon as possible. We would like this app to become mainstream and have students default to our app instead of using other apps that may provide similar resources.
