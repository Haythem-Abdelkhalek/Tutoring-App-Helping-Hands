Group/Project Title: Helping Hands

Project Description: Currently, UMBC uses a tutoring app called StudyTree which is privately owned software that deals with around 30 other Universities in the US. Unfortunately, since the app is owned by people who are not part of this university everytime a change needs to be made or support is needed the support people of the app needs to be contacted. Right now, there’s two types of tutoring sessions at UMBC Low-demand and High-demand. High-demand includes chemistry, biology, physics, economics, information systems, cmsc, spanish, and french courses, while Low-demand is any other classes. Even though, students with the high-demand can use the app to schedule a session their schedules have to be correct and up-to-date. This is usually not the case because StudyTree update their system once every semester, so if you withdraw from a course or get into a waitlisted one the changes will not show up in your schedule. For low-demand, students have to contact the supervisor of the Learning Resource Center through email to be able to see if there’s any tutors for the course they need help with. If yes, the supervisor will give them the email of the tutor and ask them to talk with them directly. This makes it very difficult for tutors to manage constant emails from students and keep track of sessions. Our mission is to create an app that includes the updated features. It will have all the courses listed in the app eliminating constant emailing between students and tutors. Also, the app will include simple messaging system for tutors and students to chat. Additionally, Supervisors can give permission to new hired tutors to become a “tutor” in the app without contacting any support. Furthermore, students can add personal details in their profile, like “student with disability”, or “retaking this course”, or “Need to practice speaking only (for language tutoring)”. This will help tutors prepare for their sessions before hand and be more efficient. The short-term goal for this app will help UMBC save money by making its own app. The long-term goal is , after debug and implementation, UMBC could sell this product to other universities. The ultimate goal is that this app would make any University’s tutoring service to be independent. The supervisor would have full control of the app (but not the code).

Task 1: Give permission to students and tutors the ability to change their schedules.
Since it is owned by people who are not part of this university, it is a pain to contact them and ask for support every time a change has to be made.
Right now, there’s two types of tutoring sessions: Low-demand and High-demand. High-demand: Chem, bio, physics, econ, is, cmsc, spanish, french. Low-demand: anything else. For high-demand, you can use the app to schedule a session. This means that your schedule has to be correct and up-to-date. This is usually not the case because StudyTree update their system once every semester. So if you withdraw from a course or get into a waitlisted one, the changes will not show up in your schedule.
For low-demand, students have to contact the supervisor of the Learning Resource Center through email to be able to see if there’s any tutors for the course they need help with. If yes, the supervisor will give them the email of the tutor and ask them to talk with them directly. This makes it very difficult for tutors to manage constant emails from students and keep track of sessions
Task 2: All courses have to be listed on the app. No emails between students and tutors.
Task 3: The app needs to have a simple messaging system for tutors and students to chat. Needed when a student is not coming or going to be late, or simply to ask any information.
Task 4: Supervisors can give permission to new hired tutors to become a “tutor” in the app.  Right now, supervisors have to contact StudyTree support to ask for it. This usually takes days.
Task 5: Students can add personal details in their profile, like “student with disability”, or “retaking this course”, or “Need to practice speaking only (for language tutoring)”. This will help tutors prepare for their sessions before hand and be more efficient.

If we end-up with this project, we will ask the tutoring supervisor if we can get financial information. We would need to know how much UMBC pays for StudyTree services and how updates work.

Short-term, this app will help UMBC save money by making its own app. Long-term, after debug and implementation, UMBC could sell this product to other universities.

The ultimate goal is that this app would make any University’s tutoring service to be independent. The supervisor would have full control of the app (but not the code).
